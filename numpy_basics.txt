Numpy -> Numerical python
Why numpy?  -> Because in python list it stores every element as an object and only keeps reference of them. This makes
them memory inefficient and very slow for numerical operations
Numpy on the other-hand stores elements in an array
-> contiguous memory location
-> elements of same data type
-> memory efficient
-> faster

Homogeneous data -> same data type storage
Because NumPy stores elements in contiguous memory blocks. For this to work efficiently, each element must occupy the
same amount of memory. Mixed data types would require variable memory sizes, which would reduce performance.
